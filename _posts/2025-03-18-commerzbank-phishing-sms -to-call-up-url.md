A nice attempt to create a phishing text message using common psychological tactics to provoke an unthinking click on the phishing link.

The approach to Commerzbank customers is interesting. The name of Comdirect - another German bank - appears in the link.

The greeting in the trivialized form is completely absurd.

As you can see, the link points to a domain that has already been recognized as a phishing website. You can use [Virustotal.com](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/url){:target="_blank"} to check URLs before getting surprised.
